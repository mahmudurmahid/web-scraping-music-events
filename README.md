## 📖 Overview

The **Web Scraping Music Events** project allows users to scrape data from music event websites, such as event titles, dates, venues, and artist information. The tool uses the power of Python's scraping libraries, like `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests`, to extract event data from HTML pages.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Implemented Features

- ✅ **Scrape music event data**: Extract information such as event name, date, location, and artists from specified websites.
- ✅ **Store event data**: Store scraped data in a structured format (JSON, CSV, or database) for easy access and analysis.
- ✅ **Filter and sort events**: Optionally filter events by date, location, or artist. Sort the events by date or other relevant fields.
- ✅ **Customizable scraping rules**: Ability to adjust scraping patterns according to specific HTML structures of target websites.
- ✅ **Multiple source support**: Scrape data from multiple event listing websites to gather a wide range of music events.

### Planned Improvements

- 🔄 **Add more scraping sources**: Add support for scraping from additional event platforms like Songkick, Bandsintown, and more.
- 🔄 **Create a web interface**: Build a simple web app to visualize the scraped event data in a user-friendly interface.
- 🔄 **Real-time scraping**: Implement scheduled scraping to get real-time updates on events.
- 🔄 **Integrate with event management platforms**: Push scraped data to platforms such as Eventbrite for event promotion.

## 📁 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.13 is installed on your system. Additionally, you need the following libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmudurmahid/web-scraping-music-events.git
cd web-scraping-music-events
```

2. Configure the scraping script:

Open the script scraper.py or scraping_config.py to adjust the target URLs, select specific events to scrape, or customize how the data is stored.

3. Run the script:

To start scraping, execute the following command:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

The script will start scraping the specified websites and save the event data to the selected output format (CSV, JSON, etc.).

4. View the output:

After scraping is complete, the data will be saved in the specified output file (e.g., events_data.csv or events_data.json).

```bash
cat events_data.csv
```

or

```bash
cat events_data.json
```

## 🌍 Scraping Sources

Currently, this project supports scraping from the following music event websites:

- Example Event Source 1: A popular platform for listing music events in cities around the world.
- Example Event Source 2: Another major event listing site for concerts, festivals, and music gigs.

You can easily add new sources by modifying the scraping_config.py file, where scraping rules for different websites are defined. Adjust the CSS selectors and HTML parsing logic according to the structure of the new target site.

## ✅ Testing

### Manual Testing

- Scraped data is stored in both CSV and JSON formats for easy verification.
- The script successfully parses event data, including event title, date, location, and artists.
- Multiple event sources are tested to ensure the tool works across various sites.

### Automated Testing (Future)

- Implement unit tests to validate the scraping functionality, data extraction, and error handling.
- Test for changes in the structure of the target websites, ensuring that the scraping process remains resilient to changes.
